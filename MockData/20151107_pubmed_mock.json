Limitation of the source of corneal cells has been\nrealized. An attempt of development of corneal epithelial-like cells from the\nhuman skin-derived precursor (hSKPs) has been made in this study. Combination of \nthree essential growth factors: epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte\ngrowth factor (KGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) could demonstrate\nsuccessfully induction of hSKPs to differentiation into corneal cells.The induced\ncells expressed the appearance of markers of corneal epithelial cells as shown by\nthe presence of keratin 3 (K3) by antibody label and Western blot assay. The K3\ngene expression of induced hSKPs cells as shown by reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology was also\ndemonstrated. The presence of these markers at both gene and protein levels could\nlead to our conclusion that the directional transdifferentiation of hSKPs cells\ninto corneal epithelial cells was successfully done under this cell induction\nprotocol. The finding shows a newly available stem cell source can be obtained\nfrom easily available skin. Cells from autologous human skin might be used for\ncorneal disorder treatment in future clinical application.","pmid":"22762041"}],"length":0,"totalResults":0,"index":0}
